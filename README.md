# AI Search Algorithms Project

This repository contains the implementation of various AI search algorithms, designed as part of the AL-2002 Term Project. The project demonstrates how search techniques can solve real-world and toy problems through a graphical interface.

## Project Overview
The project explores the use of search algorithms to simulate Artificial Intelligence capabilities. It includes uninformed, informed, and adversarial search techniques applied to graphs and visualized via a custom GUI.


## Prerequisites


- Python (3.x or later)
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VSCode)
- Basic understanding of search algorithms and their applications in AI.Additional browser support
